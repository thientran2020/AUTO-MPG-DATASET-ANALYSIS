# The report aims to analyze city-cycle fuel consumption. 
This is my MATH 161B Final Project (Group Project). 
<br> I was responsible for building a linear regression model to predict city-cycle consumption based on 8 given attributes: 
mpg, # of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year and orgin (Part 1, 2, 3 and 5 in the report pdf file).

<br> There are 5 files:
<ul>
   <li> GroupJ_DataSet: The original dataset that is used for the project. It was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository Website.
   <li> GroupJ_DataSetInfo: All information about the dataset.
   <li> MATH 161 FINAL PROJECT.ipynb: The notebook with useful graphs used to explore and visualize the data.
   <li> Linear_Regression_Auto-MPG: JMP file contains all analyses included statistical tables, QQ plots, model checking for assumptions (normality and independence) as well         as calculating R-squared adjusted.
   <li> GroupJ_WrittenReport: The final report with final results and conclusions.
<ul>
